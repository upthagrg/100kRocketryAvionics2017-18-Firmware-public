<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>This site is based on personal research and is believed to be
accurate but there is no guarantee that any of the information is
correct or suitable for any purpose. I have been told by the NMEA
folks that my information is old and out of date.  The current version of
NMEA at the time I wrote this is 3.01 which is not described
here. This site is for historical information and is not intended to
be used for any official purpose. For official data please contact the
<a href="http://www.nmea.org/">NMEA</a> web site. Please see the
bottom of this article for the sources of this data.

<a name="intro">
</a></p><h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>The National Marine Electronics Association (<a href="http://www.nmea.org/">NMEA</a>) has developed a specification
that defines the interface between various pieces of marine electronic
equipment.  The standard permits marine electronics to send
information to computers and to other marine equipment.  A full copy
of this standard is available for purchase at their web site.  None of
the information on this site comes from this standard and I do not
have a copy. Anyone attempting to design anything to this standard
should obtain an official copy.

</p><p>GPS receiver communication is defined within this specification.
Most computer programs that provide real time position information
understand and expect data to be in NMEA format. This data includes
the complete PVT (position, velocity, time) solution computed by the
GPS receiver. The idea of NMEA is to send a line of data called a
sentence that is totally self contained and independent from other
sentences.  There are standard sentences for each device category and
there is also the ability to define proprietary sentences for use by
the individual company.  All of the standard sentences have a two
letter prefix that defines the device that uses that sentence type.
(For gps receivers the prefix is GP.) which is followed by a three
letter sequence that defines the sentence contents.  In addition NMEA
permits hardware manufactures to define their own proprietary
sentences for whatever purpose they see fit.  All proprietary
sentences begin with the letter P and are followed with 3 letters that
identifies the manufacturer controlling that sentence.  For example a
Garmin sentence would start with PGRM and Magellan would begin with
PMGN.

</p><p>Each sentence begins with a '$' and ends with a carriage
return/line feed sequence and can be no longer than 80 characters of
visible text (plus the line terminators).  The data is contained within
this single line with data items separated by commas.  The data itself
is just ascii text and may extend over multiple sentences in certain
specialized instances but is normally fully contained in one variable
length sentence.  The data may vary in the amount of precision
contained in the message.  For example time might be indicated to
decimal parts of a second or location may be show with 3 or even 4
digits after the decimal point.  Programs that read the data should
only use the commas to determine the field boundaries and not depend
on column positions. There is a provision for a checksum at the end of
each sentence which may or may not be checked by the unit that reads
the data. The checksum field consists of a '*' and two hex digits
representing an 8 bit exclusive OR of all characters between, but not
including, the '$' and '*'.  A checksum is required on some sentences.

</p><p>There have been several changes to the standard but for gps use the
only ones that are likely to be encountered are 1.5 and 2.0 through
2.3.  These just specify some different sentence configurations which
may be peculiar to the needs of a particular device thus the gps may
need to be changed to match the devices being interfaced to.  Some
gps's provide the ability configure a custom set the sentences while
other may offer a set of fixed choices.  Many gps receivers simply
output a fixed set of sentences that cannot be changed by the user.
The current version of the standard is 3.01. I have no specific
information on this version, but I am not aware of any GPS products
that require conformance to this version.
 
<a name="hardware">
</a></p><h3><a name="hardware">Hardware Connection</a></h3>

<p>The hardware interface for GPS units is designed to meet the NMEA
requirements.  They are also compatible with most computer serial
ports using RS232 protocols, however strictly speaking the NMEA
standard is not RS232. They recommend conformance to EIA-422.  The
interface speed can be adjusted on some models but the NMEA standard
is 4800 b/s (bit per second rate) with 8 bits of data, no parity, and
one stop bit.  All units that support NMEA should support this
speed. Note that, at a b/s rate of 4800, you can easily send enough
data to more than fill a full second of time.  For this reason some
units only send updates every two seconds or may send some data every
second while reserving other data to be sent less often.  In addition
some units may send data a couple of seconds old while other units may
send data that is collected within the second it is sent.  Generally
time is sent in some field within each second so it is pretty easy to
figure out what a particular gps is doing.  Some sentences may be sent
only during a particular action of the receiver such as while
following a route while other receivers may always send the sentence
and just null out the values. Other difference will be noted in the
specific data descriptions defined later in the text.

</p><p>At 4800 b/s you can only send 480 characters in one second. Since
an NMEA sentence can be as long as 82 characters you can be limited to
less than 6 different sentences.  The actual limit is determined by the
specific sentences used, but this shows that it is easy to overrun
the capabilities if you want rapid sentence response. NMEA is designed
to run as a process in the background spitting out sentences which are
then captured as needed by the using program. Some programs cannot do
this and these programs will sample the data stream, then use the data
for screen display, and then sample the data again.  Depending on the
time needed to use the data there can easily be a lag of 4 seconds in
the responsiveness to changed data. This may be fine in some applications
but totally unacceptable in others. For example a car traveling at 60 mph
will travel 88 feet in one second. Several second delays could make the 
entire system seem unresponsive and could cause you to miss your turn.

</p><p>The NMEA standard has been around for many years (1983) and has
undergone several revisions.  The protocol has changed and the number
and types of sentences may be different depending on the
revision. Most GPS receivers understand the standard which is called: 0183
version 2.  This standard dictates a transfer rate of 4800 b/s. Some
receivers also understand older standards.  The oldest standard was
0180 followed by 0182 which transferred data at 1200 b/s.  An earlier
version of 0183 called version 1.5 is also understood by some
receivers.  Some Garmin units and other brands can be set to 9600 for
NMEA output or even higher but this is only recommended if you have
determined that 4800 works ok and then you can try to set it
faster. Setting it to run as fast as you can may improve the
responsiveness of the program.

</p><p>In order to use the hardware interface you will need a cable.
Generally the cable is unique to the hardware model so you will need
an cable made specifically for the brand and model of the unit you
own. Some of the latest computers no longer include a serial port but
only a USB port.  Most gps receivers will work with Serial to USB
adapters and serial ports attached via the pcmcia (pc card)
adapter. For general NMEA use with a gps receiver you will only need
two wires in the cable, data out from the gps and ground.  A third
wire, Data in, will be needed if you expect the receiver to accept
data on this cable such as to upload waypoints or send DGPS data to
the receiver.

</p><p>GPS receivers may be used to interface with other NMEA devices
such as autopilots, fishfinders, or even another gps receivers.  They
can also listen to Differential Beacon Receivers that can send data using
the RTCM SC-104 standard.  This data is consistent with the hardware
requirements for NMEA input data. There are no handshake lines defined
for NMEA.

<a name="nmea">
</a></p><h3><a name="nmea">NMEA sentences</a></h3>

<p>NMEA consists of sentences, the first word of which, called a data
type, defines the interpretation of the rest of the sentence.  Each
Data type would have its own unique interpretation and is defined in
the NMEA standard.  The GGA sentence <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#GGA">(shown below)</a>
shows an example that provides essential fix data.  Other sentences
may repeat some of the same information but will also supply new data.
Whatever device or program that reads the data can watch for the data
sentence that it is interested in and simply ignore other sentences
that is doesn't care about.  In the NMEA standard there are no
commands to indicate that the gps should do something different.
Instead each receiver just sends all of the data and expects much of
it to be ignored.  Some receivers have commands inside the unit that
can select a subset of all the sentences or, in some cases, even the
individual sentences to send. There is no way to indicate anything
back to the unit as to whether the sentence is being read correctly or
to request a re-send of some data you didn't get.  Instead the receiving
unit just checks the checksum and ignores the data if the checksum
is bad figuring the data will be sent again sometime later.

</p><p>There are many sentences in the NMEA standard for all kinds of devices
that may be used in a Marine environment.  Some of the ones that have
applicability to gps receivers are listed below: (all message start with GP.)

</li></ul>
<p>In addition some GPS receivers can mimic Loran-C receivers by outputing
the LC prefix in some of their messages so that they can be used to interface
to equipment that is expecting this prefix instead of the GP one.

<a name="2.3"></a>
</p><p>The last version 2 iteration of the NMEA standard was 2.3.  It
added a mode indicator to several sentences which is used to indicate
the kind of fix the receiver currently has. This indication is part of
the signal integrity information needed by the FAA.  The value can be
A=autonomous, D=differential, E=Estimated, N=not valid, S=Simulator.
Sometimes there can be a null value as well.  Only the A and D values
will correspond to an Active and reliable Sentence.  This mode
character has been added to the RMC, RMB, VTG, and GLL, sentences and
optionally some others including the BWC and XTE sentences.

</p><p>If you are interfacing a GPS unit to another device, including a
computer program, you need to ensure that the receiving unit is given
all of the sentences that it needs.  If it needs a sentence that your
GPS does not send then the interface to that unit is likely to fail.
Here is a <a href="http://gpsinformation.net/main/nmea3.txt">Link</a> for the
needs of some typical programs.  The sentences sent by some typical
receivers include:

</p><p>The NMEA 2.3 output from the Garmin Legend, Vista, and perhaps some 
others include the BWC, VTG, and XTE sentences.

</p><p>The Trimble Scoutmaster outputs: APA, APB, BWC, GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV,
RMB, RMC, VTG, WCV, XTE, ZTG.

</p><p>The Motorola Encore outputs: GGA, GLL, GSV, RMC, VTG, ZDA and a 
proprietary sentence <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#PMOTG">PMOTG</a>.

</p><p>Units based on the SiRF chipset can output: GGA, GLL, GSA, GSV,
RMC, and VTG.  What is actually output is based on which sentences are
selected by the user or application program. See <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#sirf">below</a> for more details.  Some implementations have
enhanced the SiRF capabilities with other sentences as well by
changing the firmware.  For example, the u-blox receivers add ZDA and
some proprietary sentences to the above list of sentences. Check your
documentation for more details.

</p><p>Garmin receivers send the following Proprietary Sentences:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#PGRME">PGRME</a> (estimated error) - not sent if set to 0183 1.5
</li><li><a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#PGRMM">PGRMM</a> (map datum)
</li><li><a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#PGRMM">PGRMZ</a> (altitude)
</li><li><a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#PSLIB">PSLIB</a> (beacon receiver control)
</li></ul>

<p>Note that Garmin converts lat/lon coordinates to the datum chosen
by the user when sending this data.  This is indicated in the
proprietary sentence PGRMM.  This can help programs that use maps with
other datums but is not an NMEA standard.  Be sure and set your datum
to WGS84 on Garmin units when communicating to other NMEA devices.

</p><p>Magellan also converts lat/lon coordinates to the datum chosen on
the receiver but do not indicate this in a message. Magellan units use
proprietary sentences for waypoint maintenance and other tasks. They
use a prefix of PMGN for this data.

</p><p>Most other units always output NMEA messages in the WGS84 datum.  Be
sure and check the user documentation to be sure.

</p><p>It is possible to just view the information presented on the NMEA
interface using a simple terminal program.  If the terminal program can
log the session then you can build a history of the entire session into
a file.  More sophisticated logging programs can filter the messages to
only certain sentences or only collect sentences at prescribed intervals.
Some computer programs that provide real time display and logging actually
save the log in an ascii format that can be viewed with a text editor or
used independently from the program that generated it.

<a name="input">
</a></p><h4><a name="input">NMEA input</a></h4>

<p>Some units also support an NMEA input mode. While not too many
programs support this mode it does provide a standardized way to
update or add waypoint and route data.  Note that there is no
handshaking or commands in NMEA mode so you just send the data in the
correct sentence and the unit will accept the data and add or
overwrite the information in memory.  If the data is not in the
correct format it will simply be ignored. A carriage return/line feed
sequence is required.  If the waypoint name is the same you will
overwrite existing data but no warning will be issued.  The sentence
construction is identical to what the unit downloads so you can, for
example, capture a <a href="http://www.gpsinformation.org/dale/nmea.htm#WPL">WPL sentence</a> from one unit and
then send that same sentence to another unit but be careful if the two
units support waypoint names of different lengths since the receiving
unit might truncate the name and overwrite a waypoint accidently.  If
you create a sentence from scratch you should create a correct
checksum.  Be sure you know and have set you unit to the correct
datum.  Many units support the input of WPL sentences and a few
support RTE as well.

</p><p>On NMEA input the receiver stores information based on interpreting
the sentence itself.  While some receivers accept standard NMEA input this can
only be used to update a waypoint or similar task and not to send a
command to the unit.  Proprietary input sentences could be used to
send commands. Since the Magellan upload and download maintenance
protocol is based on NMEA sentences they support a modified WPL
message that adds comments, altitude, and icon data.

</p><p>Some marine units may accept input for alarms such as deep or
shallow water based on the DPT sentence or MTW to read the water
temperature. For example the Garmin Map76 supports DPT, MTW
(temperature), and VHW (speed) input sentences. Other units may use
NMEA input to provide initialization data via proprietary sentences,
or to select which NMEA sentences to output.

<p>If the height of geoid is missing then the altitude should be
suspect.  Some non-standard implementations report altitude with
respect to the ellipsoid rather than geoid altitude.  Some units
do not report negative altitudes at all.  This is the only
sentence that reports altitude.

</p><p><a name="GSA">
<b>GSA</b></a> - GPS DOP and active satellites. This sentence provides
details on the nature of the fix.  It includes the numbers of the
satellites being used in the current solution and the DOP. DOP
(dilution of precision) is an indication of the effect of satellite
geometry on the accuracy of the fix.  It is a unitless number where
smaller is better.  For 3D fixes using 4 satellites a 1.0 would be
considered to be a perfect number, however for overdetermined
solutions it is possible to see numbers below 1.0.  

</p><p>There are differences in the way the PRN's are presented which can
effect the ability of some programs to display this data.  For
example, in the example shown below there are 5 satellites in the
solution and the null fields are scattered indicating that the almanac
would show satellites in the null positions that are not being used as
part of this solution.  Other receivers might output all of the
satellites used at the beginning of the sentence with the null field
all stacked up at the end.  This difference accounts for some
satellite display programs not always being able to display the
satellites being tracked.  Some units may show all satellites that
have ephemeris data without regard to their use as part of the solution
but this is non-standard.

the satellites that the unit might be able to find based on its
viewing mask and almanac data.  It also shows current ability to track
this data.  Note that one GSV sentence only can provide data for up to
4 satellites and thus there may need to be 3 sentences for the full
information.  It is reasonable for the GSV sentence to contain
more satellites than GGA might indicate since GSV may include
satellites that are not used as part of the solution.  It is not
a requirment that the GSV sentences all appear in sequence.  To
avoid overloading the data bandwidth some receivers may place
the various sentences in totally different samples since each
sentence identifies which one it is.

</p><p>The field called SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the NMEA standard
is often referred to as signal strength.  SNR is an indirect but more
useful value that raw signal strength.  It can range from 0 to 99 and
has units of dB according to the NMEA standard, but the various
manufacturers send different ranges of numbers with different starting
numbers so the values themselves cannot necessarily be used to
evaluate different units. The range of working values in a given gps
will usually show a difference of about 25 to 35 between the lowest
and highest values, however 0 is a special case and may be shown
on satellites that are in view but not being tracked.

</p><p>Note: some autopilots, Robertson in particular, misinterpret

correct thing to do for the data in the same field.  APA only differs
from APB in this one field and APA leaves off the last two fields

</p><h4>Garmin</h4>

<p>The following are Garmin proprietary sentences.  "P" denotes
proprietary, "GRM" is Garmin's manufacturer code, and "M" or "Z"
indicates the specific sentence type. Note that the PGRME sentence
is not set if the output is set to NMEA 1.5 mode.

<a name="PSLIB">PSLIB</a>

<p>Proprietary sentences are used to control a Starlink differential
   beacon receiver. (Garmin's DBR is Starlink compatible as are many
   others.)  When the GPS receiver is set to change the DBR frequency
   or b/s rate, the "J" sentence is replaced (just once) by (for
   example): $PSLIB,320.0,200*59 to set the DBR to 320 KHz, 200 b/s.

</p><pre>      $PSLIB,,,J*22   Status request
      $PSLIB,,,K*23   configuration request
</pre>

<p>These two sentences are normally sent together in each group of
sentences from the GPS. The three fields are: Frequency, bit Rate,
Request Type.  The value in the third field may be: J = status request,
K = configuration request, or null (blank) = tuning message.
The correct values for frequency range from 283.5-325.0 KHz while the
bit rate can be set to 0, 25, 50, 100 or 200 bps.

</p><h4>Magellan</h4>

<p>Magellan uses proprietary sentences to do all of their waypoint and
route maintenance.  They use the MGN prefix for their sentences. This
use is documented in their interface specification and will not be

GSV, VTG, RMC and some proprietary sentences.

<a name="sirf"></a>
</p><h4>SiRF</h4>

<p>The SiRF line of chips support several input sentences that permit the
user to customize the way the chip behaves.  In addition SiRF has a binary
protocol that is even more powerful permitting different implementations
to behave entirely differently.  However, most applications do not attempt
to customize the behavior so a user will need to make sure that the
any customization is compatible with the application they are planning to
use.  There are 5 input sentences defined that begin with $PSRF which is
followed by three digits.  Each sentence takes a fix amount of input fields
which must exist, no null fields, and is terminated with the standard
CR/LF sequence.  The checksum is required.

</p><p>The sentences 100 and 102 set the serial ports. 100 sets the main
port A while 102 sets the DGPS input port B.  100 has an extra field
that can be used to switch the interface to binary mode. Binary mode
requires 8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. There is a command in binary
mode that will switch the interface back to NMEA. Do not use the NMEA
command to switch to binary mode unless you have the ability to switch
it back. You could render your gps inoperative.

</p><pre> $PSRF100,0,9600,8,1,0*0C
 $PSRF102,9600,8,1,0*3C

   $PSRF100

   *0C        checksum
</pre>

<p>The sentences 101 and 104 can be used to initialize values to be used by
the gps.  Supplying these values can shorten the initial lock time.  If
the clock offset is set to 0 then an internal default will be used.  
Sentence 101 supplies data in the internal ECEF (Earth centered, Earth
Fixed) format in meters while sentence 104 supplies the data in the
traditional Lat / Lon format.

</p><pre> $PSRF101,-2686700,-4304200,3851624,95000,497260,921,12,3*22

              8 = cold start, set factory defaults
   *3A        checksum
</pre>

<p>The sentence 103 is used to control which NMEA sentences are to be sent
and how often.  Each sentence type is controlled individually.  If the
query bit is set then the gps responds by sending this message in the next
second no matter what the rate is set to. Note that if trickle power is
in use (can only be set in binary mode) then the actual update rate will
be the selected update rate times the trickle rate which could mean that
the data will be sent less frequently than was set here.

</p><pre> $PSRF103,05,00,01,01*20

   $PSRF103

   *20        checksum
</pre>

<p>The 105 sentence controls a debug mode which causes the gps to report
any errors it finds with the input data.  $PSRF105,1*3E would turn debug
on while $PSRF105,0*3F would turn it off.

</p><h4>Magnavox</h4>

<p>The old Magnavox system used mostly proprietary sentences. The
Magnavox system was acquired by Leica Geosystems in 1994. Information
on this system can be found at <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/html/drivers/driver9.html">this
site</a>. The NMEA sentences themselves are described <a href="http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ntp/ntp_spool/html/mx4200data.html">here</a>.

Here are some observations:
<ul>
<li>Notice the complete cycle shows an update interval of 2 seconds
    which is caused by the fact that there is too much data to fit
    in one second at 4800 b/s.
</li><li>Upping the b/s rate to 9600 will cause an update every second.
</li><li>Notice that the samples are in real time for each sentence because
    the GGA sentence shows an update in the time of 1 second.
</li><li>It would be possible to provide update data every second by
    parsing more sentences since the data is adjusted every second.
</li><li>Notice the gaps in the GSA message where the satellites in use
    are shown in a there slots as compared to the GSV locations.
    Some tools do not decode this configuration correctly.
</li><li>Note the GGA sentence starts the sequence every two seconds.
</li><li>This sample is similar for other Garmin receivers designed in
    the same time frame as the G-12.

<li>Information is buffered.  It is all for the same second.
</li><li>Information is only updated every two seconds at 4800 b/s.
</li><li>Lat/Lon numbers have an extra digit.

Some observations:
<ul>
<li>A cycle is every second triggered off of GGA.
</li><li>The GSA, GSV sentences are only sent every 4 seconds or so. The actual
    sentences sent and the rate is adjustable using proprietary NMEA commands.
</li><li>Altitude is based on the ellipsoid model and is not corrected 
    for geoid. Note that no geoid corrections are shown in GGA.
</li><li>All headings are stated as true direction. There are no magnetic
    direction outputs.
</li><li>The ,0000 at the end of GGA is non standard.
</li><li>Lat/Lon has an extra digit as compared to the Garmin G-12.
</li><li>The clock is shown with millisecond precision.
</li><li>The Navman sends 10 lines of non-nmea ascii data when it is first 
    turned on. Each line does begin with a $.
</li><li>This is a sample sentence sequence. The Navman can be programmed to
    send less sentences or sentences at a different rate.
</li><li>The Navman uses the SiRF chipset, see above for more data on this chipset.
</li><li>Sentences are stated to be NMEA 2.2 based on documentation.

Some observations in comparison with the NavMan.
<ul>
<li>This unit show WAAS/EGNOS (WADGPS) in use. The GGA sentence shows a 
    2 indicating differential gps corrections.  The 1.5 at the end shows 
    the age of the dgps correction signal.
</li><li>This is a new chipset firmware release and does support Geoid height
    in the altitude as shown in the GGA sentence.
</li><li>The RMC sentences shows that there is no support for Magnetic headings.
</li><li>When WAAS/EGNOS was not in use a GLL sentence showed up after the GGA.
